T-Test for Salaries by Gender, whether or not gender plays a role
 T-Statistic: 1.49
 P-Value: 0.14

The result is not statistically significant so we fail to reject the null hypothesis
There is no significant difference in salaries between males and females.

Shapiro-Wilk Test for Bachelor's:

Shapiro-Wilk Test for Master's:
  Statistic: 0.937, P-Value: 0.000
  Not Normally Distributed

ANOVA stat:
The F-statistic is 158.780. This measures the ratio of variance between the group means to the variance within the groups.
The P-value is 0.000. Since the P-value is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis.This indicates that there is a statistically significant
 difference in mean salaries across the different education levels.

Is median income different between groups? Kruskal-Wallis:

Kruskal-Wallis Test: H-statistic = 167.246, P-Value = 0.000
Reject the null hypothesis, which suggests that at least one group's median salary differs, statistically significent, from the others
